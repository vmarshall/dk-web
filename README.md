## Quickstart

## Web Starter Kit and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) or other CSS libraries?

Web Starter Kit doesn't aim to compet e with CSS libraries like Bootstrap, Foundation and Pure. These libraries provide an excellent solution for prototyping your initial project. The biggest challenge they present is itâ€™s almost too easy to get stuck using their look and feel for the lifetime of your site. We think this leads to a poorer experience on the multi-screen web.

Web Starter Kit provides boilerplate styles & a visual style guide for projects, but encourages customising these to fit your own site. This may need a little more work, but the reality is that any serious project is going to have its own look and feel. We want you to feel comfortable changing the kit to suit your own needs.

If you wish to use Bootstrap or other CSS libraries in your Web Starter Kit project, you have the flexibility to do so.

## Troubleshooting

If you find yourself running into issues during installation or running the tools, please check our [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/wiki/Troubleshooting) guide and then open an [issue](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/issues). We would be happy to discuss how they can be solved.

## A Boilerplate-only Option

If you would prefer not to use any of our tooling, delete the following files from the project: `package.json`, `gulpfile.js`, `.jshintrc` and `.travis.yml`. You can now safely use the boilerplate with an alternative build-system or no build-system at all if you choose.

## Extras

Optional additions, such as web server configurations, can be found at [WSK Extras
repository](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit-extras).
